# Sudoku - A Game Made with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

# Introduction
Sudoku is a well known and popular puzzle game where a user is challenged correctly ascertain combinatorial number placement. Whilst all Sudoku games are based on the same principles, there are many different versions where different features are available to the user. A basic version would typically supply the board in which to solve the puzzle whereas this version is more advanced and aims to provide the user with many features such as ability to track time taken to solve the puzzle, pause the game, undo or redo actions taken, use notes to aid the completion of the puzzle, choose to hear music whilst they play and auto-solve the puzzle should the user wish. To add additional challenge the user can change the difficulty, and the number of errors made is recorded during a game encouraging replayability so as to beat their previous score. When the game is complete the user is either congratulated and shown the difficulty setting chosen, the time taken and the number of errors made. If the game not been completed correctly then the user is presented with a commiseration message.

## User Experience

### User Requirements

Some example user stories which have affected the design:

* As a person who enjoys Sudoku, I want to get straight into playing the
 game. I have played other versions and find them a little aesthetically dull and lack features.

* As a person who hasn't played before, I would like to read the rules of the
 game. I want to know exactly how to play and what to expect

* As a person that likes a challenge, I would like the option of a more
 difficult game




## Design

### Initial Concept - Wireframes
* The majority of the initial design was followed with only a few alternations made such as giving the digit selection buttons and note mode buttons a different coloured background when selected.

### Website Structure
* Sudoku website consists of 2 main pages: Home Page and Game Page.
* One additional page exists, a 404 Error Page.
* The Home Page has 4 sections: (1) Title and Game Start button, (2) Rules, (3) image highlting features and the function, (4) buttons to Start Game and Home (returns to top of page). 
* The Game Page is broken down into sections for different button placement surrounding the center puzzle board.
* Home Page and Game Page are accessible to each other. 404 page is accessed should the url not be recognised.

### Colour Scheme
* There are three main colours used throughout the website: (1) dark red (#721200), (2) beige (#d8cdb7), (3) dark beige (#bdb29f). 4 supplementary colours used to provide contrast are: (1)'white', (2)'green' and (3)'skyblue' and (4)'black'.<br>
* All colours were picked to either compliment or work in contrast to the background image which was found via Google Images. (royalty free)
* The background image provides a light wood effect which acts as a more interesting background than a block colour, but also serves to not be too distracting either. <br>

### Typography
* The Permenant Marker font is used for the main logo and headings. Chosen for being bold, playful and hard to miss.
* The Lustria font is used everywhere else as is easy to read but also offers a playful look to the numbering on the Sudoku board without being distracting or hard to read.<br>

### Imagery

* There are only two images used on this site. The first is the wood background on all pages and was sourced from Google Images. The second is a screenshot of the game itself to act as a tool to assist users on how to use functions within the game. Microsoft paint was used to add text and arrows. 

* Both images have been converted to webp format using
[cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/).
