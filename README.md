# Sudoku - A Game Made with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

# Introduction
Sudoku is a well know and popular puzzle game which challenges a user's ability to apply logic and ascertain the correct combinatorial number placement. Whilst all Sudoku games are the same when comparing the rules, there are many different versions where users have different features available to them. A basic version would simply supply the board in which to solve the puzzle whereas this version is more advanced and aims to provide the user with many features such as ability to track time taken to solve the puzzle, pause the game, undo or redo actions taken, use notes to aid the completion of the puzzle, choose to hear music whilst they play and auto solve the puzzle should the user wish. To add additional challenge the user can select different difficulties and the number of errors made is recorded. When the game is complete the user is either congratulated one completing the puzzle correctly and presented with confirmation of the difficulty setting chosen, the time taken and the number of errors made. If the user has made an error at the stage of completion they are presented with a commiseration message.

## Design

### Initial Concept - Wire Frames
* The majority of the initial design was followed with only a few alternations made such as giving the digit selection buttons and note mode buttons a different coloured background when selected.

### Website Structure
* Sudoku website consists of 2 main pages: Home Page and Game Page.
* One additional page exists, a 404 Error Page.
* The Home Page has 4 sections: (1) Title and Game Start button, (2) Rules, (3) image highlting features and the function, (4) buttons to Start Game and Home (returns to top of page). 
* The Game Page is broken down into sections for different button placement surrounding the center puzzle board.
* Home Page and Game Page are accessible to each other. 404 page is accessed should the url not be recognised.

### Colour Scheme
* There are three main colours used throughout the website: (1) dark red (#721200), (2) beige (#d8cdb7), (3) dark beige (#bdb29f). 4 supplementary colours used to provide contrast are: (1)'white', (2)'green' and (3)'skyblue' and (4)'black'.<br>
* All colours were picked to either resemble or work in contrast to the background image.
* The background image provides a light wood effect which acts as a more interesting background than a block colour, but does not distract the user from the game. <br>
